java:
- object oriented programming lauguage
- developed by sun microsystem in 1995
- james Gosling is the father of java
- before java its name was Oak
- owned by oracle corporation
- run on more than 10 billion devices

used for:
- Mobile applications
- Desktop applications
- Web applications
- web servers and application servers
- games
- database connection

why use java?
- works on different platforms(windows, mac, linux, etc)
- most popular programming language in the world
- large demand in current job market
- easy to learn and use
- open source and free
- secure fast and powerful
- large community support
- gives clear structure to programers and allow to reuse , lowering the devemopment cost
- close to c++ and c# makes easy to switch between these.

Features of java:
01 - object oriented programming
    - Everything in java is an object.
    - Object that incorporate Data and Behavior.
    - Basic concept of OOP's:
        - object
        - Class
        - Inheritance
        - Polymorphism
        - Abstraction
        - Encapsulation
02 - simple
    - easy to learn and its sytax is simple,clean and easy to understand.
    - As per Sun Microsystem - java is Simple Language.
    - removed complicated and rarely-used Features
        - explicit pointers
        - operator overloading
    - Automatic Garbage collection is present in JAVA
03 - secured
    - best known form security
    - can develop virus free systems
    - no explicit pointers
    - java programs run inside a virtual machine sandbox
    - classLoader: 
        - part of JRE(java Runtime Environment)
        - used to load java classes into java virtual machine
        - provide security by seperating package for classes of local file systems from those that are imported from network sources.
    - ByteCodeVerifier:
        - check code fragments for illegal code that can voilate access rights to objects.
    - Security Manager:
        - detarmines what resources a class can access such as reading and writing to the local disk.
    - java provides these securities by default.
04 - platform independent
    - write once , run anywhere(WORA).
    - java provide software-based platform.
    - java has two components:
        - Runtime Environment
        - API(Application Programming Interface)
        - java code -> compilor -> byte code(platform independent) -> Runtime Environment -> output
05 - Robust(strong)
    - uses strong memory management.
    - lack of pointers that avoids security problems.
    - provide automatic Garbage collection which runs on java virtual machine.
    - exception handling and type checking also present there.
06 - Portable
    - it carry bytecode to any platform.
07 - architacture Natural
    - 4 bytes for both 32 & 64 bits.
08 - Dynamic
    - it support dynamic supports dynamic loading of classes.
    - it means classes are load on demand.
    - also supports functions from native languages.(c,c++)
    - support dynamic compilation and automatic memory management(garbage collection)
09 - Interpreted
10 - High Performance
    - faster than other Interpreted language(python) and little bit slower than compiled language(c++)
11 - Multithreaded
    - seperate program , excuting concurrently.
    - java defines multiple tasks as once (multiple threads).
    - it doesn't occupy memory for each thread.(this is its main feature).
    - threads are important for multimedia,web applicaitions,etc

#.Class : user defined data type which groups data members and its associated functions together.

#.Object : basic unit of OOP and represents real life entities.(instance of class)
